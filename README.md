Airline Reservation System


Project Overview
The Airline Reservation System is a simple console-based application developed in Java that allows users to view available flights, book tickets, and cancel bookings. The system simulates the basic functionality of an airline reservation system that includes the management of flight data and seat availability.

Features

Users can view the available flights with details such as flight number, destination, and available seats.

Book a Flight

Cancel a Flight
Users can cancel their flight bookings by providing the flight number. The system will increase the available seats for the cancelled booking.

User Interaction via Command Line
The system is designed with a simple command-line interface, where users can select from a menu of options to interact with the system.
