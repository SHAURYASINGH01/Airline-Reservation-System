1. Project Purpose and Scope
Strengths:
The project clearly addresses the primary functionalities required in an airline reservation system, such as flight searching, seat selection, booking management, cancellations, and administrative control.
It supports both customer and admin roles, with a well-defined separation of concerns between user-facing features (e.g., booking flights) and administrative features (e.g., flight and customer management).
The use of Java as the core programming language and JavaFX for the GUI ensures platform independence, making it suitable for both Windows and macOS environments.
Weaknesses:
The system's scope is somewhat limited in terms of advanced features like dynamic pricing, online payments, or integration with other airline systems (e.g., real-time flight status updates from airlines).
Mobile responsiveness is not considered. A mobile version could significantly expand the system’s reach.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Integrate dynamic pricing based on demand and availability.
Add a payment gateway to allow customers to complete bookings directly through the system.
Extend functionality to support international flights and multi-leg bookings.
Create a mobile app version or a responsive web version to reach a wider audience.
2. System Architecture
Strengths:
The client-server architecture with a dedicated frontend (JavaFX) and backend (Java with MySQL/SQLite) provides a solid foundation for scalability and separation of concerns.
Database design is well-structured with normalized tables for users, flights, bookings, and schedules, making the data model flexible and scalable.
Weaknesses:
The project does not mention integration with third-party APIs for real-time flight information, such as flight delays or seat availability from external sources.
Concurrency management: If the system experiences high traffic, there could be potential issues with handling multiple users booking the same seat or querying flight availability at the same time.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Implement real-time flight data integration with external APIs (e.g., from airlines or flight data providers).
Add concurrency control mechanisms such as synchronization or locking to handle multiple users making bookings for the same flight or seat at the same time.
3. User Interface (UI)
Strengths:
The JavaFX GUI is a good choice for creating interactive and user-friendly desktop applications.
Clear distinction between customer and admin dashboards ensures ease of use, and each user role has access to the features they need.
The search function for flights based on various filters (source, destination, date) is a highly valuable feature for the customer experience.
Weaknesses:
The UI design can be made more modern and intuitive with better use of visual design patterns (e.g., material design or flat UI).
While functionality is present, the overall user experience (UX) could be improved by introducing features like suggested flights, user profile management, or saved preferences for frequent travelers.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Enhance the UI to make it more modern by using a better color scheme, more interactive controls, and responsive elements.
Add filter options for advanced search, such as price range or airline.
Provide a notification system for users (e.g., reminders for upcoming flights, cancellations, etc.).
4. Code Structure and Maintainability
Strengths:
The project’s modular code structure makes it easy to maintain and extend. The separation of controllers, models, views, and utils promotes clean coding practices and adherence to the MVC architecture.
Reusability is high since each module is relatively self-contained and only communicates with other modules through well-defined interfaces.
Weaknesses:
The project could benefit from more error handling and input validation, especially when dealing with user inputs (e.g., invalid booking dates, incorrect flight data).
Logging and debugging mechanisms are not mentioned. These could help with troubleshooting issues and tracking user activity, especially in a production environment.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Implement logging (e.g., using Log4j or SLF4J) for tracking system activities and errors.
Add error handling and input validation at both the client and server sides.
Ensure unit tests and integration tests are created for core modules such as flight booking, seat management, and user authentication.
5. Database Design
Strengths:
The database design is normalized and includes relevant tables for users, flights, bookings, and flight schedules. This ensures efficient querying and data consistency.
The use of foreign keys ensures referential integrity between the tables (e.g., linking bookings to users and flights).
Weaknesses:
The database schema does not account for certain advanced features, such as multiple seat types (economy, business class), flight class, or special pricing rules (e.g., discounts, loyalty points).
The system could benefit from additional indexing on frequently queried fields like flight_number, source, destination, and departure_date to improve performance.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Consider adding tables for seat types and flight class to manage the booking of different seat categories.
Add indexing on high-demand fields to improve query performance.
Backup mechanisms should be implemented to ensure data safety, especially considering the importance of flight and booking information.
6. Security
Strengths:
The project ensures basic role-based access control (admin vs. customer).
Passwords should be encrypted before being stored, which is mentioned in the system design.
Weaknesses:
The encryption method for passwords is not detailed. Storing passwords in plain text (even within the project’s database) is a security risk.
There is no mention of data encryption for sensitive information, such as credit card details or personal information.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt) for password storage instead of encryption to ensure password security.
If handling sensitive data like credit card information, implement TLS (Transport Layer Security) and consider PCI-DSS compliance.
Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for users, especially admin users.
7. Testing
Strengths:
The system has a clear modular structure, which makes it conducive to unit testing.
Weaknesses:
There is no mention of automated testing (unit, integration, or UI testing).
The project may lack comprehensive test cases, especially for critical functionalities like booking, cancellation, and seat availability.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Write unit tests for the core business logic.
Implement integration tests to test interactions between modules.
Use UI testing frameworks (e.g., TestFX for JavaFX) to test the GUI.
8. Performance and Scalability
Strengths:
The system’s client-server architecture allows for scalability, particularly when more users and flights are added to the system.
Weaknesses:
The application might face performance issues when dealing with a high volume of users (e.g., simultaneous bookings for the same flight).
The system currently does not handle asynchronous tasks, such as fetching flight data or handling bookings concurrently.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Consider implementing asynchronous programming for long-running tasks such as querying the database or processing bookings.
Implement load testing to simulate real-world traffic and ensure the system can handle large numbers of concurrent users.
Conclusion
The Airline Reservation System provides a robust base for managing flight bookings, cancellations, and administrative tasks. While the system covers the core functionalities expected from such a platform, there are areas for improvement in security, scalability, usability, and advanced features like payment integration and mobile support.

By addressing these weaknesses and adding more sophisticated features, the system can be made more resilient, user-friendly, and production-ready, providing a comprehensive solution to users and administrators alike.
